# Hash Sum (the browser version)

This is the same package as [Hash Sum link](https://github.com/bevacqua/hash-sum) but it works in the browser by adding a global variable (window or worker).

## Why?

I needed a this for a project where I could access the HashSum as a variable in the window and worker objects so I also needed it to be on a CDN :)
